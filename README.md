[![Highfivery. We help brands create digital solutions to make them more engaging and profitable.](https://dashboard.highfivery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/banner.webp)](https://www.highfivery.com/contact)

A Next.js 13 CMS-agnostic starter application to build fully-featured headless sites with built-in support for WordPress.

## Introduction

This project is in **beta** and under **active development** &mdash; not ready for use for production. Our first release is intended to give basic functionality, standardization & WordPress integration. Our goal is to create a Next.js starter framework that:

* isn't dependent on a particular theming framework &mdash; setup theming how you like
* is CMS-agnostic with baked in support for WordPress, Drupal & Shopify
* provides out-of-the-box support for [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/)
* built-in [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) integration
* helps enforce coding standards with [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) & [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
